% The predicate colour_countries/1 is our main entry-point which
%  we will later use to invoke the program. It first uses setof/3
%  to create a list of terms in the form Country/Var. It then uses
% colours/2 to bind each Var in this list to an appropriate colour.
colour_countries(Colours) :-
  setof(Country/_, X^neighbours(Country,X), Colours),
  colours(Colours).

% The predicate colours/1 just returns true if there are no elements
% in a given list.
colours([]).

% For a list of head Country/Colour and tail Rest, the predicate
% colours/2 colours all the Rest. Then selects a value for Colour
% from the list of candidates, then check that there is no country
% in Rest which neighbours the Country just coloured and had the
% same Colour.
colours([Country/Colour | Rest]):-
  colours(Rest),
  member(Colour, [green, yellow, red, purple]),
  \+ (member(CountryA/Colour, Rest), neighbour(Country, CountryA)).

% The predicate neighbour/2 determines whether or not two given
% countries are neighbours.
neighbour(Country, CountryA):-
  neighbours(Country, Neighbours),
  member(CountryA, Neighbours).

% The member/2 predicate we have used in colours/1 and neighbours/2
% is just a standard membership utility function which checks if X
% is a member of a given list.
member(X, [X|_]).
member(X, [_|Tail]):-
  member(X, Tail).

% Let us now execute the program by invoking colour_countries/1.
